# Wealth Playground (Working Title)

A web application designed to visualize and explore the scale of extreme wealth through interactive comparisons and data visualizations.

## About

This project aims to put astronomical sums of money (like billionaire fortunes and company market caps) into perspective by comparing them to relatable metrics, country GDPs, global problem costs, and more. It's built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

The goal is to be informative, engaging, and maybe a little bit absurd.

## Features (Current & Planned)

*   Browse top billionaires and companies.
*   Interactive "Playground" to simulate spending vast fortunes on various items.
*   Compare wealth to country GDPs and global problem costs (using Recharts).
*   "Absurdity Metrics" section for fun, mind-bending comparisons.
*   Wealth stack visualization comparing $100 bill stacks to real-world objects.
*   Responsive design for various screen sizes.
*   (Planned) Enhanced landing page visuals.
*   (Planned) SEO optimization.
*   (Planned) AdSense integration.
